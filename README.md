# Project-Matrix
The Matrix class is a C++ template designed to handle mathematical matrices. It features a constructor for initializing matrices with specified dimensions and values, overloads for arithmetic operators to perform matrix operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication, and methods for matrix transposition and symmetry checks. Additionally, it provides access to individual matrix elements using the [] operator and supports easy input and output using the << and >> operators, making it a versatile tool for matrix manipulations.'
